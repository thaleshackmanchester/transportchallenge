# Hack Machester - Transport Challenge

###Background
[Thales](http://ukearlycareers.thalesgroup.com/)  are delighted to be supporting this year’s [Hack Manchester Junior edition](http://www.hackmanchester.com/junior) as part of the Manchester Science festival. Thales are a leading engineering and technology company which is continually solving complex problems for the benefits of millions of people. We have selected a challenge from one of our key business domains (Transportation) and we hope you will enjoy rising to the challenge.

###Challenge

**Given real-time train information, develop an innovative way of communicating this information in a useful way to someone you know.**

There will be prizes (including Raspberry PIs and MakeyMakey kits) for the winning team.

###Helpful hints!

* There will be two types of data available. One relates to station specific data (e.g. trains arriving and departing), and one is train specific data (e.g. where is the 1440 train from London to Manchester). The data can be made available in a number of formats – this can be discussed with the mentors during the event. http://nrodwiki.rockshore.net/index.php/Main_Page contains some useful tips.

* Access to the live data requires a free account, you can register for your account here: http://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/

* Examples of current uses of the data include:
  * http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/ldbboard/dep/MAN  (example of station specific webpage)
  * http://bit.ly/ManPicLiveTrainDepartures (example of platform customer information systems)

* We would be delighted to see a Manchester theme in your solution.

* As regards the file format of the data, the default data format is JSON but the Thales mentors will help if this format is unfamiliar to you.

We are sure you will come up with some great ideas but we have a number of ideas to share with you at the event if you are struggling.
