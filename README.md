# Thales Hack Machester - Transport Challenge

**Given real-time train information, develop an innovative way of communicating this information in a useful way to someone you know.**

##Helpful hints!

* There will be two types of data available. One relates to station specific data (e.g. trains arriving and departing), and one is train specific data (e.g. where is the 1440 train from London to Manchester). The data can be made available in a number of formats â€“ this can be discussed with the mentors during the event. http://nrodwiki.rockshore.net/index.php/Main_Page contains some useful tips.

* Access to the live data requires a free account. This can be arranged at the start of the event.

* Examples of current uses of the data include:
  * http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/ldbboard/dep/MAN  (example of station specific webpage)
  * http://bit.ly/ManPicLiveTrainDepartures (example of platform customer information systems)

* We would be delighted to see a Manchester theme in your solution.

We are sure you will come up with some great ideas but we have a number of ideas to share with you at the event if you are struggling.
